# Disable Re-directing Twitter Timeline Thumbnails To Original Sizes

As of 1.7.0, if you have "Redirect Twitter image URLs" enabled, (it is by default), this extension will also replace thumbnails on the timeline with the full size image.  

This may not be desirable if you have limited bandwidth or a slow internet.

You can disable re-directing the thumbnails:  

1. Click the hamburger menu in the top-right corner of your browser  
2. Open "More Tools" -> "Extensions"  
3. Find the Lemon X extension and click "Details"  
4. Un-check "Automatically allow access on the following sites"  
5. Re-check "*://pbs.twimg.com/*"
